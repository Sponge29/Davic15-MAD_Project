# MAD_Project
MAD Group 31
I started a New project to create the layout that we will use in the whole proyect. The layout I chose was from templates that 
Android Studio shows when creates a new project.
I modified some stuffs and I created a class and layout for each tab, and the layout also added a floating button.
The setting menu is there but is nothing on it.
